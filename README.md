# RNN

The code demonstrates the use of a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to perform binary text classification using TensorFlow and Keras. It begins by defining a few sample sentences and their corresponding binary labels. The text data is preprocessed using Kerasâ€™ Tokenizer to convert words into integers, and pad_sequences ensures all sequences have the same length. A Sequential model is then created with three layers: an Embedding layer that transforms word indices into dense 8-dimensional vectors (word embeddings), a SimpleRNN layer with 16 units that captures sequential patterns and contextual meaning in the text, and a final Dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, suitable for binary output. It is trained over 10 epochs, and given the simplicity of the data, the model typically achieves low loss and high accuracy, demonstrating how RNNs can be used effectively for small-scale NLP tasks.
